# detect-parkinsons-disease
```Parkinson disease is associated with movement disorder symptoms, such as tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. The manifestation of bradykinesia and rigidity is often in the early stages of the disease. These have a noticeable effect on the handwriting and sketching abilities of patients, and micrographia has been used for early-stage diagnosis of Parkinsonâ€™s disease. While handwriting of a person is influenced by a number of factors such as language proficiency and education, sketching of a shape such as the spiral has been found to be non-invasive and independent measure.```
